Ingredients:
 - One 3 1/2-pound chicken
 - 1 large onion, finely chopped
 - 1 rosemary sprig
 - One 4-inch cinnamon stick
 - 1 bay leaf
 - One 14-ounce package frozen molokhia (see Note) or two 10-ounce packages chopped frozen spinach
 - 1 tablespoon minced garlic
 - 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
 - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
 - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
 - 1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika
 - Steamed short-grain rice, for serving

Directions:
  1. In a large, deep pot, cover the chicken with the onion, rosemary, cinnamon stick and bay leaf and 12 cups of water. Top with a small plate to keep the chicken submerged and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat until the chicken is cooked through, 45 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter and let cool slightly, then cut into wings, breasts, thighs and drumsticks and pat dry.
  2. Strain the broth into a heatproof bowl. Skim off the fat. Return 2 cups of the broth to the pot; reserve the remaining broth for another use. Add the molokhia to the pot and simmer for 10 minutes.
  3. Meanwhile, using the side of a knife, mash the garlic to a paste with 1 tablespoon of the coriander. In a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the garlic paste and cook over moderately high heat until golden and fragrant, about 1 minute. Scrape the paste into the molokhia and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper.
  4. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of coriander with the ground cinnamon, cumin, paprika and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Sprinkle the chicken all over with the spices. In a large nonstick skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the chicken and cook over high heat, turning once, until golden and heated through and the skin is crisp, about 4 minutes.
  5. Mound rice in the center of 4 or 5 shallow bowls and top with the chicken. Ladle the molokhia around the chicken and serve.
